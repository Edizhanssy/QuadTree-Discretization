# QuadTree-Discretization
Quadtree Discretization Code 

 Python IDE: PyCharm

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of Quadtree Discretization, specifically designed for discretizing a plate with a specified radius. Quadtrees, as hierarchical data structures, are crucial in fields like software engineering, geometry, gaming, collision detection, and image processing.
The quadtree discretization is done according to the data generated with using function avaliable in the code; however, domain which will be having its coordinates of points can be discretized using this code. The partitioning process of each depth can be identified with the different colours attained.
Quadtrees are hierarchial data structures, which are extensively used especially in softwares, geometry engines, games, especially finding a data within the specific area or domain, collision detection, and Image Processing.

* Contribution
Any contributions and feedback welcome to improve this project. If you have ideas, or enhancements, please feel free to change to for your use.

The quadtree structure that is used in this code is to discretize a domain in this case a Simple Plate is applied as embeeded domain.

* The structure of the Quadtree as Follows
