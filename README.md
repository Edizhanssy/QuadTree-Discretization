# QuadTree-Discretization
Quadtree Discretization Code - Torque Arm
In addition, a quadtree discretization of an Plate with certain radius can also be found
The torque arm discretization is done via getting the meshes and with using intersection constraints on the boundary of the torque arm, 
the torque arm discretization is made.
