# QuadTree-Discretization

 Python IDE: PyCharm

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of Quadtree discretization, specifically designed for discretizing a plate with a specified radius. Quadtrees are hierarchial data structures, which are extensively used especially in softwares, geometry engines, and games, especially finding a data within the specific area or domain, collision detection, and Image Processing.


The quadtree discretization is done according to the plate data generated with using function avaliable in the code; however, domain which will be having its points of coordinates can be discretized using this code. The partitioning process of each depth can be identified with the different colours attained.


Any contributions and feedback is welcome to improve this project. If you have ideas, or enhancements, please feel free to change to for your own use.
